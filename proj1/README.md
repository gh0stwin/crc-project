## CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT
# COMPUTING IT
> python3 clustering.py N N_SAMPLES
where N is the number of nodes for BA and DMS, and N_SAMPLES is the number of samples to run for computing clustering coefficent before averaging it 
# PLOTTING IT 
> python3 clustering_graph.py N SHOW_ALL_BA_VALUES
where N is the number of nodes for BA and DMS (files to load and plot), and SHOW_ALL_BA_VALUES is a boolean to show all BA values for the clustering coefficient

## DEGREE DISTRIBUTION
# COMPUTING AND PLOTTING IT
> python3 degree_dist.py
This is currently hardcoded for 10^6 nodes with its specific cutoff points.
